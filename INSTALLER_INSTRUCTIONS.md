# Building Professional Windows Installer

## 🎯 Overview

This creates a professional MSI-style installer that:
- ✅ **Eliminates all security warnings** (when signed)
- ✅ **Looks completely professional**
- ✅ **Installs like commercial software**
- ✅ **Appears in Add/Remove Programs**
- ✅ **Creates proper shortcuts**
- ✅ **Handles Python installation automatically**
- ✅ **Can be digitally signed for trust**

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### 1. Install NSIS (Free)
Download from: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download
- Choose "Latest stable release"
- Install with default options
- Add to PATH environment variable

### 2. Install Windows SDK (Free) - For Signing
Download from: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/
- Only needed if you want to digitally sign
- Provides `signtool.exe` for signing

## 🚀 Quick Build

### Method 1: Batch Script (Easiest)
```cmd
# Just double-click this file:
build_installer.bat
```

### Method 2: PowerShell (Recommended)
```powershell
# Basic build
.\build_installer.ps1

# Build and sign (with certificate)
.\build_installer.ps1 -Sign -CertificatePath "mycert.pfx" -CertificatePassword "mypassword"
```

### Method 3: Manual NSIS
```cmd
makensis installer.nsi
```

## 📦 What Gets Created

The installer will be named: `Instagram_Auto_Poster_Installer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.exe`

## 🔐 Digital Signing (Professional)

### Why Sign?
- ✅ **No "Unknown Publisher" warnings**
- ✅ **Windows SmartScreen trust**
- ✅ **Corporate environment compatibility**
- ✅ **User confidence**

### Get Certificate:
1. **Purchase** from CA (DigiCert, Sectigo, etc.) - $200-500/year
2. **Self-sign** for testing (will still show warnings)
3. **EV Certificate** for immediate trust (recommended)

### Sign Command:
```cmd
signtool sign /f "certificate.pfx" /p "password" /t "http://timestamp.digicert.com" /fd sha256 "installer.exe"
```
